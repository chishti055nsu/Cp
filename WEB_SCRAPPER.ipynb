It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.<br /><br /><strong>Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)</strong>: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.<br /><br /><strong>Urinary Tract Infections</strong>:&nbsp;e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species. Cefim-3 is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes.\\n                    </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n<div class=\"tx-0-9 mt-5 mb-15\"><a href=\\'https://medex.com.bd/news/104/danger-of-taking-medication-without-doctors-advice\\' target=\\'_blank\\'><i>* \\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x9c\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\x9f\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xa1 \\xe0\\xa6\\x9a\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa7\\x8e\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0 \\xe0\\xa6\\xaa\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xb6 \\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa7\\x8b\\xe0\\xa6\\xa4\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x95 \\xe0\\xa6\\x94\\xe0\\xa6\\xb7\\xe0\\xa6\\xa7 \\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x81\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8</i></a>\\'</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-300\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-220 cb-mt-10 cb-mb-15 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"d-flex v-center justify-center\">\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-310\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-end cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 mr-3c \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-315\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-start cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-320\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-325\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-326\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"d-flex v-center justify-center\">\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-327\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm h-center cb-mxh-200 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 mr-3c \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-328\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm h-center cb-mxh-200 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-327-m\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-200 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-328-m\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-200 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"d-flex v-center justify-center\">\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-330\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-end cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 mr-3c \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-335\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-start cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-340\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-345\" class=\"campaign-block h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n        <div id=\"mode_of_action\">\\n            <h3 class=\"ac-header\">Pharmacology</h3>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"ac-body\">\\n                            Cefixime is a third generation semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic for oral administration.

The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. <br /><br /><strong>Adults and children over 10 years</strong>: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. <br /><br /><strong>Elderly</strong>: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. <br /><br /><strong>Children</strong>: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: <br />\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily</li>\\r\\n<li>Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily</li>\\r\\n<li>Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<strong>In typhoid</strong>: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. <br /><br /><strong>Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years</strong>: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. <br /><br /><strong>Children aged less than 6 months</strong>: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.<br /><br /><strong>Dosage in Renal Impairment</strong>: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.\\n                    </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"tx-0-9 mt-5 mb-15\"><a href=\\'https://medex.com.bd/news/104/danger-of-taking-medication-without-doctors-advice\\' target=\\'_blank\\'><i>* \\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x9c\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\x9f\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xa1 \\xe0\\xa6\\x9a\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa7\\x8e\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0 \\xe0\\xa6\\xaa\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xb6 \\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa7\\x8b\\xe0\\xa6\\xa4\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x95 \\xe0\\xa6\\x94\\xe0\\xa6\\xb7\\xe0\\xa6\\xa7 \\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x81\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8</i></a>\\'</div>\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-500\" class=\"campaign-block  \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n    <div class=\"d-flex v-center justify-center\">\\n        <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-510\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-end cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 mr-3c \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-515\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-start cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-520\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-525\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n        <div id=\"interaction\">\\n            <h3 class=\"ac-header\">Interaction</h3>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"ac-body\">\\n                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients.

The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Cefim-3 are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.\\n                    </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-700\" class=\"campaign-block  \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n        <div id=\"pregnancy_cat\">\\n            <h3 class=\"ac-header\">Pregnancy &amp; Lactation</h3>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"ac-body\">\\n                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Cefim-3, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Cefim-3 should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

in-vitro bactericidal activity against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organism. It is indicated for the treatment of the following acute infections when caused by susceptible microorganisms.<br /><br /><strong>Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)</strong>: e.g. otitis media; and other URTI where the causative organism is known or suspected to be resistant to other commonly used antibiotics, or where treatment failure may carry significant risk. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections-e.g. bronchitis.<br /><br /><strong>Urinary Tract Infections</strong>:&nbsp;e.g. cystitis, cystourethritis, pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in infections caused by commonly occurring pathogens including Streptococcus pneumonia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive and negative), Moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive and negative) and Enterobacter species.

The usual course of treatment is 7 days. This may be continued for up to 14 days if required. <br /><br /><strong>Adults and children over 10 years</strong>: The recommended adult dosage is 200-400 mg daily according to the severity of the infection, given either as a single dose or in two divided doses. <br /><br /><strong>Elderly</strong>: Elderly patients may be given the same dose as recommended for adults. Renal function should be assessed and dosage should be adjusted in severe renal impairment. <br /><br /><strong>Children</strong>: The recommended dosage for children is 8 mg/kg/day administered as a single dose or in two divided doses. As a general guide for prescribing in children the following daily doses in terms of volume of suspension are suggested: <br />\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>6 months up to 1 year: 3.75 ml daily</li>\\r\\n<li>Children 1-4 years: 5 ml daily</li>\\r\\n<li>Children 5-10 years: 10 ml daily</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<strong>In typhoid</strong>: the recommended children dose is 5 mg/kg body weight twice daily for 10-14 days. <br /><br /><strong>Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10 years</strong>: Should be treated with the recommended adult dose 200-400 mg daily depending on the severity of infection. <br /><br /><strong>Children aged less than 6 months</strong>: The safety and efficacy of Cefixime has not been established in children aged less than 6 months.<br /><br /><strong>Dosage in Renal Impairment</strong>: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be given in patients with creatinine clearances of 20 ml/min or greater. In patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 20 ml/min, it is recommended that a dose of 200 mg once daily should not be exceeded. The dose and regimen for patients who are maintained on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis should follow the same recommendation as that for patients with creatinine clearances of less than 20 ml/min.\\n                    </div>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\"tx-0-9 mt-5 mb-15\"><a href=\\'https://medex.com.bd/news/104/danger-of-taking-medication-without-doctors-advice\\' target=\\'_blank\\'><i>* \\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x9c\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\x9f\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xa1 \\xe0\\xa6\\x9a\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xbf\\xe0\\xa7\\x8e\\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0 \\xe0\\xa6\\xaa\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x8d\\xe0\\xa6\\xb6 \\xe0\\xa6\\xae\\xe0\\xa7\\x8b\\xe0\\xa6\\xa4\\xe0\\xa6\\xbe\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\x95 \\xe0\\xa6\\x94\\xe0\\xa6\\xb7\\xe0\\xa6\\xa7 \\xe0\\xa6\\xb8\\xe0\\xa7\\x87\\xe0\\xa6\\xac\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8 \\xe0\\xa6\\x95\\xe0\\xa6\\xb0\\xe0\\xa7\\x81\\xe0\\xa6\\xa8</i></a>\\'</div>\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-500\" class=\"campaign-block  \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n    <div class=\"d-flex v-center justify-center\">\\n        <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-510\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-end cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 mr-3c \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-515\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-xs hidden-sm justify-start cb-mb-10 cb-mxh-205 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-520\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    <div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-525\" class=\"campaign-block hidden-md hidden-lg h-center cb-mxh-110 cb-mt-5 cb-mb-10 \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n        <div id=\"interaction\">\\n            <h3 class=\"ac-header\">Interaction</h3>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"ac-body\">\\n                            In common with other cephalosporins, increases in prothrombin times have been noted in a few patients.

The majority of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were mild and self limiting in nature. Gastrointestinal disturbances: The most frequent side-effects seen with Cefim-3 are diarrhoea and stool changes; diarrhoea has been more commonly associated with higher doses. Other gastrointestinal side-effects seen less frequently are nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting and flatulence. Pseudomembraneous colitis has been reported. Central nervous system: headache and dizziness. Hypersensitivity reactions: allergies in the form of rash, pruritis, urticaria, drug fever and arthralgia have been observed. These reactions usually subsided upon discontinuation of therapy. Hematological and clinical chemistry: thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and eosinophilia have been reported. These reactions were infrequent and reversible. Mild transient change in liver and renal function tests have been observed. Miscellaneous: other possible reactions include genital pruritis and vaginitis.\\n                    </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n<div id=\"cre-brand-generic--pos-700\" class=\"campaign-block  \"></div>\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<div>\\n        <div id=\"pregnancy_cat\">\\n            <h3 class=\"ac-header\">Pregnancy &amp; Lactation</h3>\\n        </div>\\n        <div class=\"ac-body\">\\n                            There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

Cephalosporin should be given with caution to penicillin-sensitive patients, as there is some evidence of partial cross-allergenicity between the penicillins and the cephalosporins. Patients have had severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) to both classes of drugs. If an allergic effect occurs with Cefim-3, the drug should be discontinued and the patient treated with appropriate agents if necessary. Cefim-3 should be administered with caution in patients with markedly impaired renal function. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces. Dosage & Administration Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Interaction All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs.

Unit Price: ৳ 0.78 (200's pack: ৳ 156.00) Alternate Brands Indications This is indicated for symptomatic relief of hyperacidity associated with the peptic ulcer, gastritis, peptic oesophagitis, gastric hyperacidity, heartburn, sour stomach or hiatus hernia. It is effective in the prevention of stress ulceration and GI bleeding. It acts as an antiflatulent to alleviate the symptoms of gas including post operative gas pain. This rapidly relieves acid pain, disperses gastric foam and facilitates eructation of gas and air. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Composition Each tablet contains- Dried Aluminium Hydroxide Gel BP (Al2O3, 47% minimum): 425.53 mg Magnesium Hydroxide BP: 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg \\r Each 5 ml contains- Aluminium Oxide (Equivalent amount of Aluminium Hydroxide Gel USP): 200 mg Magnesium Hydroxide (Equivalent amount of Magnesium Hydroxide Paste USP): 400 mg Simethicone USP: 30 mg Pharmacology This is the mixture of non-systemic acid neutralizing substances and antiflatulent. This preparation offers reliability as well as long action. Aluminium Hydroxide and Magnesium Hydroxide induce the relief of ulcer by neutralizing gastric acid secreted from parietal cells of the stomach. The clinical use of simethicone is based on its antifoam properties. Simethicone spreads on the surface of aqueous liquids, forming a film of low surface tension and causing collapse of foam bubbles. Simethicone repeatedly allows mucous surrounded gas bubbles in the GI tract to coalesce and be expelled.This is used in the treatment of flatulence and meteorism for the elimination of gas, air or foam from the gastro-intestinal tract prior to radiography and for the relief of abdominal distension and dyspepsia. Simethicone is physiologically inert; it does not appeared to be absorbed from the GI tract to interfere with gastric secretion or absorption of nutrients. Following oral administration, the drug is excreted unchanged in the feces. Dosage & Administration Tablet: 1-2 tablets 1-3 hours after meal and at bed time or as directed by the physician.Suspension: 1-2 teaspoonful 1-3 hours after meal and at bedtime or as directed by the physician. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Interaction All antacids may increase or decrease the rate and/or extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral drugs.

Two receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB, mediate the effects of ET-1 in the vascular smooth muscle and endothelium. The primary actions of ETA are vasoconstriction and cell proliferation, while the predominant actions of ETB are vasodilation, antiproliferation, and ET-1 clearance. Ambrisentan is a high-affinity ETA receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ETA versus ETB receptor (>4000-fold). The clinical impact of high selectivity for ETA is not known.The pharmacokinetics of Ambrisentan (S-Ambrisentan) in healthy subjects are dose proportional. The absolute bioavailability of Ambrisentan is not known. Ambrisentan is absorbed with peak concentrations occurring approximately 2 hours after oral administration in healthy subjects and PAH patients. Food does not affect its bioavailability. In vitro studies indicate that Ambrisentan is a substrate of P-gp. Ambrisentan is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). The elimination of Ambrisentan is predominantly by non-renal pathways, but the relative contributions of metabolism and biliary elimination have not been well characterized. In plasma, the AUC of 4-hydroxymethyl Ambrisentan accounts for approximately 4% relative to parent Ambrisentan AUC. Thein vivo inversion of S-Ambrisentan to R-Ambrisentan is negligible. The mean oral clearance of Ambrisentan is 38 mL/min and 19 mL/min in healthy subjects and in PAH patients, respectively. Although Ambrisentan has a 15-hour terminal half-life, the mean trough concentration of Ambrisentan at steady-state is about 15% of the mean peak concentration and the accumulation factor is about 1.2 after long-term daily dosing, indicating that the effective half-life of Ambrisentan is about 9 hours. Dosage & Administration Adult dose: Initial treatment is 5 mg once daily, and can be increased to 10 mg once daily if 5 mg is tolerated. Ambrisentan may be administered with or without food.Pediatric patients: The safety and effectiveness of Ambrisentan in pediatric patients have not been established. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Interaction Multiple dose co-administration of Ambrisan and Cyclosporine resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in Ambrisan exposure in healthy volunteers; therefore, limit the dose of Ambrisan to 5 mg once daily when co-administered with Cyclosporine. Contraindications Ambrisentan may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Ambrisentan is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Pregnancy must be excluded before the initiation of treatment with Ambrisentan and prevented during treatment and for one month after stopping treatment. Ambrisentan is contraindicated in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) including IPF patients with pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3). Side Effects Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have followed administration of other endothelin receptor antagonists and were observed in clinical studies with Ambrisan Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy Category X. It is not known whether Ambrisentan is excreted in human milk. Breastfeeding while receiving Ambrisentan is not recommended. Precautions & Warnings Fluid Retention: Peripheral edema is a known class effect of endothelin receptor antagonists, and is also a clinical consequence of PAH and worsening PAH. Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease: If patients develop acute pulmonary edema during initiation of therapy with vasodilating agents such as Ambrisan, the possibility of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease should be considered, and if con_rmed. Ambrisan should be discontinued. Hematological Changes: Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have followed administration of other endothelin receptor antagonists and were observed in clinical studies with Ambrisan.Hepatic impairment: Ambrisan is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

It acts on the pre-synaptic membrane, enhancing the release of dopamine and inhibiting its reuptake. Post-synaptically, Amantadine acts directly on the dopamine receptor, and up regulates D2 receptors. This may be due to Amantadine-induced hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. It has antimuscarinic properties. Amantadine also has antiglutamatergic properties, via non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, potent, competitive, non-subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists reduce the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. NMDA receptor sensitization may be a key event in the genesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. It also has immunomodulatory properties. It restores the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is defective in Parkinson’s disease patients. The mechanism by which Amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. Amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine. Dosage & Administration Parkinson's disease- Adults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day when used alone. The initial dose of Amantadine is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs. After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary. Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses. Dosage for Concomitant Therapy: Some patients who do not respond to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs may respond to Amantadine. When Amantadine or anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs are each used with marginal benefit, concomitant use may produce additional benefit. When Amantadine and levodopa therapy are initiated concurrently, the patient can exhibit rapid therapeutic benefits. Amantadine dose, should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit. When Amantadine is added to optimal well-tolerated doses of levodopa, additional benefit may result, including smoothing out the fluctuations in improvement which sometimes occur in patients on levodopa alone. Patients who require a reduction in their usual dose of levodopa because of development of side effects may possibly regain lost benefit with the addition of Amantadine. Drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions- Adults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day. Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 300 mg daily in divided doses. Prophylaxis and treatment of Influenza A virus illness- Adults: 200 mg/day as single dose or 100 mg twice daily. If CNS effects develop on a once- daily dosage, split dosage schedule may reduce complaints. Elderly over 65 years of age: 100 mg every day. Children: 1 to 9 years of age: 4.4 to 8.8 mg/kg/day; not to exceed 150\\u2009mg/day. 9 to 12 years of age: 100 mg twice daily Method of administration: Each capsule is to be taken orally either with or without food.Patients with renal impairment: The dose should be reduced. This can be achieved by either reducing the total daily dose, or by increasing the dosage interval in accordance with the creatinine clearance.Patients with hepatic impairment: Use with caution. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Interaction Concurrent administration of Amantril and anticholinergic agents or levodopa may increase confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, gastro-intestinal disturbances, or other atropine-like side effects. Psychotic reactions have been observed in patients receiving Amantril and Levodopa. Concurrent administration of Amantril and drugs or substances (e.g. alcohol) acting on the CNS may result in additive CNS toxicity. Close observation is recommended. Contraindications Amantadine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Side Effects The adverse effects of Amantril are generally mild and, when they occur, may diminish or cease after a week or more on the medication. The most commonly reported side effects include nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness, and insomnia. Other side effects may include edema of ankles, livedo reticularis; anxiety, elevation of mood, headache, lethargy, hallucinations, ataxia, slurred speech, blurred vision, loss of concentration, nervousness, depression, myalgia, palpitations, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, anorexia, constipation and diaphoresis. Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy category C. No well-controlled studies have been done in pregnant women to evaluate Amantadine’s safety. Amantadine may be used during pregnancy when the potential benefits outweigh the potential but unknown risks to the fetus. Amantadine is excreted into breast milk in low concentrations. As no information is available on the effects in infants, therefore amantadine should be used cautiously in women who are breastfeeding. Precautions & Warnings Amantril should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of Amantril should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech. Overdose Effects Deaths have been reported from overdose with Amantril. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Because some patients have attempted suicide by overdosing with Amantril, prescriptions should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management.Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of Amantril. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity. Cardiac dysfunction includes arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress have been reported; renal dysfunction including increased BUN, decreased creatinine clearance and renal insufficiency can occur. Central nervous system effects include insomnia, anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia, gait abnormality, tremor, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, fear, delirium, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, lethargy, somnolence and coma. Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed.There is no specific antidote for an overdose of Amantril. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by Amantril. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of Amantril. Since the excretion rate of Amantril increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered. The patient should be observed for the possible development of arrhythmias and hypotension; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic and antihypotensive therapy should be given. Electrocardiographic monitoring may be required after ingestion, since malignant tachyarrhythmias can appear after overdose.

Unit Price: ৳ 3.00 (60's pack: ৳ 180.00) Also available as: 50 mg/5 ml (Syrup) Alternate Brands Innovator's Monograph Indications Influ is indicated for- Treatment of parkinsonism Treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions Prophylaxis and treatment of signs and symptoms of infection caused by various strains of influenza A virus * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Pharmacology Amantadine Hydrochloride has direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons. It acts on the pre-synaptic membrane, enhancing the release of dopamine and inhibiting its reuptake. Post-synaptically, Amantadine acts directly on the dopamine receptor, and up regulates D2 receptors. This may be due to Amantadine-induced hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. It has antimuscarinic properties. Amantadine also has antiglutamatergic properties, via non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, potent, competitive, non-subunit selective NMDA receptor antagonists reduce the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. NMDA receptor sensitization may be a key event in the genesis of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. It also has immunomodulatory properties. It restores the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is defective in Parkinson’s disease patients. The mechanism by which Amantadine exerts its antiviral activity is not clearly understood. It appears to mainly prevent the release of infectious viral nucleic acid into the host cell by interfering with the function of the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein. Amantadine is also known to prevent virus assembly during virus replication. It does not appear to interfere with the immunogenicity of inactivated influenza A virus vaccine. Dosage & Administration Parkinson's disease- Adults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day when used alone. The initial dose of Amantadine is 100 mg daily for patients with serious associated medical illnesses or who are receiving high doses of other antiparkinson drugs. After one to several weeks at 100 mg once daily, the dose may be increased to 100 mg twice daily, if necessary. Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 400 mg daily in divided doses. Dosage for Concomitant Therapy: Some patients who do not respond to anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs may respond to Amantadine. When Amantadine or anticholinergic antiparkinson drugs are each used with marginal benefit, concomitant use may produce additional benefit. When Amantadine and levodopa therapy are initiated concurrently, the patient can exhibit rapid therapeutic benefits. Amantadine dose, should be held constant at 100 mg daily or twice daily while the daily dose of levodopa is gradually increased to optimal benefit. When Amantadine is added to optimal well-tolerated doses of levodopa, additional benefit may result, including smoothing out the fluctuations in improvement which sometimes occur in patients on levodopa alone. Patients who require a reduction in their usual dose of levodopa because of development of side effects may possibly regain lost benefit with the addition of Amantadine. Drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions- Adults: The usual dose is 100 mg twice a day. Occasionally, patients whose responses are not optimal with Amantadine at 200 mg daily may benefit from an increase up to 300 mg daily in divided doses. Prophylaxis and treatment of Influenza A virus illness- Adults: 200 mg/day as single dose or 100 mg twice daily. If CNS effects develop on a once- daily dosage, split dosage schedule may reduce complaints. Elderly over 65 years of age: 100 mg every day. Children: 1 to 9 years of age: 4.4 to 8.8 mg/kg/day; not to exceed 150\\u2009mg/day. 9 to 12 years of age: 100 mg twice daily Method of administration: Each capsule is to be taken orally either with or without food.Patients with renal impairment: The dose should be reduced. This can be achieved by either reducing the total daily dose, or by increasing the dosage interval in accordance with the creatinine clearance.Patients with hepatic impairment: Use with caution. * রেজিস্টার্ড চিকিৎসকের পরামর্শ মোতাবেক ঔষধ সেবন করুন' Interaction Concurrent administration of Influ and anticholinergic agents or levodopa may increase confusion, hallucinations, nightmares, gastro-intestinal disturbances, or other atropine-like side effects. Psychotic reactions have been observed in patients receiving Influ and Levodopa. Concurrent administration of Influ and drugs or substances (e.g. alcohol) acting on the CNS may result in additive CNS toxicity. Close observation is recommended. Contraindications Amantadine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. Side Effects The adverse effects of Influ are generally mild and, when they occur, may diminish or cease after a week or more on the medication. The most commonly reported side effects include nausea, dizziness/lightheadedness, and insomnia. Other side effects may include edema of ankles, livedo reticularis; anxiety, elevation of mood, headache, lethargy, hallucinations, ataxia, slurred speech, blurred vision, loss of concentration, nervousness, depression, myalgia, palpitations, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, anorexia, constipation and diaphoresis. Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy category C. No well-controlled studies have been done in pregnant women to evaluate Amantadine’s safety. Amantadine may be used during pregnancy when the potential benefits outweigh the potential but unknown risks to the fetus. Amantadine is excreted into breast milk in low concentrations. As no information is available on the effects in infants, therefore amantadine should be used cautiously in women who are breastfeeding. Precautions & Warnings Influ should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of Influ should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech. Overdose Effects Deaths have been reported from overdose with Influ. The lowest reported acute lethal dose was 1 gram. Because some patients have attempted suicide by overdosing with Influ, prescriptions should be written for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient management.Acute toxicity may be attributable to the anticholinergic effects of Influ. Drug overdose has resulted in cardiac, respiratory, renal or central nervous system toxicity. Cardiac dysfunction includes arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Pulmonary edema and respiratory distress have been reported; renal dysfunction including increased BUN, decreased creatinine clearance and renal insufficiency can occur. Central nervous system effects include insomnia, anxiety, agitation, aggressive behavior, hypertonia, hyperkinesia, ataxia, gait abnormality, tremor, confusion, disorientation, depersonalization, fear, delirium, hallucinations, psychotic reactions, lethargy, somnolence and coma. Seizures may be exacerbated in patients with prior history of seizure disorders. Hyperthermia has also been observed.There is no specific antidote for an overdose of Influ. However, slowly administered intravenous physostigmine in 1 and 2 mg doses in an adult at 1- to 2-hour intervals and 0.5 mg doses in a child at 5- to 10-minute intervals up to a maximum of 2 mg/hour have been reported to be effective in the control of central nervous system toxicity caused by Influ. For acute overdosing, general supportive measures should be employed along with immediate gastric lavage or induction of emesis. Fluids should be forced, and if necessary, given intravenously. The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of Influ. Since the excretion rate of Influ increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body. The blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature should be monitored. The patient should be observed for hyperactivity and convulsions; if required, sedation, and anticonvulsant therapy should be administered. The patient should be observed for the possible development of arrhythmias and hypotension; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic and antihypotensive therapy should be given. Electrocardiographic monitoring may be required after ingestion, since malignant tachyarrhythmias can appear after overdose.

It improves sputum rheology by hydrating mechanism leading to liquefaction of mucus in the lumen of respiratory tract, thus facilitating expectoration of mucus and reducing dyspnea. It stimulates production of phospholipids of surfactant by alveolar cells, thus contributing to the lowering of superficial tension in the alveoli. It also reduces bronchial hyperactivity. Ambroxol has anti inflammatory properties owing to the inhibitory effect on the production of cellular cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites. In patients with COPD it traditionally improves airway patency.
